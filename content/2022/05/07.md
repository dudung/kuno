It was seven to ten, wasn't it? Now it was six. Second repository in GitHub using GitJournal app. Raw Editor is chosen. Problem number '0n' will be change to 'n', where 0 < n < 10. Adding 'x' will preserve the '0', so I use 'x07' for this note.

The *italic*, **bold**, ***bold and italic***, ~strikethrough~ are working for this note.
