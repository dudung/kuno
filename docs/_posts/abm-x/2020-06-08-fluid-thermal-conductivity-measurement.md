Effects of Methylation on Chemical Bond and Thermophysical Properties of Ionic Based Imidazolium Cation

Above was the title of presentation [[1](#ref1)] from Yunita Anggraini, where following is the measurement system supervised mainly by Dr. Daniel Kurnia.

Fig 1 Measurement system of fluid conductivity thermal.

Observed results are then fitted using model [[2](#ref2)]

\begin{equation}
\kappa = A + BT + CT^2,
\end{equation}

by determining the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ through least square method.

## Note
Purpose of this post is the future plan to produce Fig 1 using JS, X3DOM, Three.js, or SVG, with a real problem. In `js-draw-apparatus` there is only the image file without any JS files for description.

## Edit
2020-06-08 Create this post. Require further action for implementation. <br />
