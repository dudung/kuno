Slide can be made using JS only for saving bandwidth of WFH condition.

## Brief idea
Instead of  make movie from slide, where the result is with large size, the slide can be made using JS only and later the movie is also made with the same way. But for now it is still in the slide stage [[1](#ref1)].

Fig 1 First version of js-slide (not yet js-anim-slide).

The equation is with MathJax and the image is drawn in Canvas. So both are created in user side. Slide snapshot in PNG format is about 20 KB, while the two JS and one HTML files are only about 7 KB.

Red and black border in Fig 1 are for guidance only, where it can be hidden in its use.
