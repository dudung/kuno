## Set path for command line
If you are more convenient to work with CLI (command line input), a batch file, e.g. `setrpath.bat` with content
```batch
:: 
:: setrpath.bat
:: set path for Rscript.exe in R for Windows 4.0.2
:: 
:: Sparisoma Viridi | https://github.com/dudung/butiran
:: 
:: 20200711
:: 1312 Document the reference [1], which is persistent.
:: 1314 Test it and ok.
:: 1607 Use non-persistent [2].
:: 1608 Replace REM with :: since it is faster 6x [3].

:: Set environment variable only for this session [2]
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.2\bin\

:: View hint
echo Rscript from R for Windows 4.0.2
```
can be called through a shortcut to `cmd.exe` with target
```
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k L:\home\butiran\learn\r\setrpath.bat
```
You can make a shortcut by right click on a file and choose Create shortcut.

## Execute a R script
Suppose that there is following R script
```r
if(FALSE) {
'
	comment.R
	An example multi-line comments in R
	
	Sparisoma Viridi | https://github.com/dudung/butiran
	
	20200711
	1151 Add reference [1].
	1619 Change it to [2].

}

# Just two lines after code description
msg <- "An example multi-line comments in R"
print(msg)
```
in `basics` folder relative to the shortcut. After open the CLI an action of
```batch
L:\>Rscript basics\comment.R
```
will produce
```batch
[1] "An example multi-line comments in R"
```
as expected.
